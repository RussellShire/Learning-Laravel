# LEARNING LARAVEL

This repo is for me to follow Laravel Projects such as Laracasts 'Laravel 8 from scratch' and Traversy Media 'Laravel From Scratch 2022'.

Projects in these repos will generally follow pretty closely to these existing courses.

Each project will have its own folder with README at that level. Organising the repo this way to keep my basic projects that closely follow courses collected together. 
In the future more bespoke Laravel projects that diverge from courses more significantly will have their own repos.

Projects in these repos will contain an unusual amount of comments and some commits that would be inappropriate for production code. 
However, this means the repo will be able to function as a resource I can refer back to for find best practice in future projects.  

Laravel Sail and Docker is largely being used as a dev environment throughout.
